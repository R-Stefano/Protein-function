The folder **extract** contains the code to parse the uniprot.xml [file](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=*&fil=reviewed%3Ayes) and the go.obo [file](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.obo). The results are three files containing the amino acid sequence, their GO ids and the map between DO id-function category.

The folder **evaluate** is used to compare the model with a baseline such as BLAST.
