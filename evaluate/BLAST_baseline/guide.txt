This folder contains the scripts to setup and evaluate BLAST on Uniprot.

1. generateFASTA.py creates the FASTA file with all the sequences to query against Uniprot using BLAST

2. After installed locally Uniprot DB (the same used for training the model) and setup a local BLAST search from here:
https://github.com/edamame-course/BLAST-tutorial/blob/master/running-BLAST.md
Run the BLAST search using the sequences in the FASTA file and save the results in a file.

The command to run the BLAST search is:
blastp -db uniprot_db/uniprot_DB -query queries.fasta -outfmt 10 -num_alignments 10 -num_threads 3 -out results_queries.csv

paramters to run BLAST locally:

3. extractBLASTSearchResults.py loades the results of BLAST search and extract the best matching reference (excluded first 100 identity to avoid 100% accuracy). The best matching reference for each sequence is saved on a file to then query Uniprot to extract the go notations

4. queryUniprot.py queries the Uniprot server to retrieve the Go notations of each sequence reference in order to build the predictions of BLAST to compare with the model
